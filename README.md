As mentioned in the client requirements, mall spending is a key indicator:
- **Low Risk**: ‚â§5% of monthly income
- **Moderate Risk**: 5-15% of monthly income
- **High Risk**: >15% of monthly income

Example: A person with ‚Çπ20,000 salary visiting malls 4 times/month with ‚Çπ2,000-4,000 spending would have 40-80% of income going to mall expenses, indicating poor financial discipline.

- **Optional Fields (30% weight)**: Additional data for better risk assessment

### Real-time EMI Calculation
```javascript
EMI = P √ó r √ó (1 + r)^n / ((1 + r)^n - 1)
Where:
P = Principal amount
r = Monthly interest rate
n = Number of months
```
